# Tally
Elementary school teacher data management tool. Specifically, Tally would organize data on a child's progress from worksheets and readings.

# Problem
My wife is a 3rd-grade teacher and she struggles to track and measure the progress of each child. Currently, she uses google docs and has to write in every word the child misread and every score from assignments she gives. This takes her hours to input the information and then to find/query info is extremely frustrating. She currently spends $20 a weeks for random things she thinks will make her more efficient. So, there is a dollar value to her time.

# Solution
We create a simple app that stores and organizes student data and then creates query options that will help her make better decisions. 
  1. Simple Speach To Text function to allow the teacher to make notes without typing
  2. Photo taking function that allows the teacher to upload the worksheets automatically.
  3. Progress report function that queries the child's information.

# Why this project?
We can build an MVP with a limited feature set pretty easily and get a good grade. The MVP may just store scores and the completion of worksheets and then if the team wants to we could add some machine learning or computer vision tools to help process and learn about the students to further help teachers make better decisions.

# Business
A free app with a paid version that includes data analytics and learning algorithms. I think this kind of data will be important in the future of A.I.

# Legal
Privacy: We can use fake data for the class and then simply have a terms and services agreement.

Business: Ideas usually are worth nothing. We could use the startup method of "slicing the pie" if people want to actually pursue this otherwise it will just be a school project.
