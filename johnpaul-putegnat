When this project idea was presented I actually thought that it was an absolutely great idea that I could get behind.  
I value teachers and the work they do a lot and am incredibly passionate about education.  
To be apart of a team that creates a tool to assist teachers would be very fun.  

I have android programming and SQL experience, but am very open to putting in time to assist in other areas as well and learn new tools if I need to.

As far as the business goes, if this is just a school project, that's okay.  
I am also very passionate about entrepreneurship so if there's a possibility that this goes further, I would very much be on board to keep going.  
The potential impact this tool could have seems great, especially if the data was used to help provide potential improvements to elementary education.
