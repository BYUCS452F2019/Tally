I have several friends who are teachers and I know that this is a big issue for them as well.
They put in so much time and effort every day that I feel like this could really help them with their jobs
I have both front end and mobile development experience (vuejs, flutter, android, angularjs) as well as 
experience with both relational databases (MSSQL, My SQL) and NoSQL databases (Google Cloud Firestore 
and Realtime Database), so I feel like I can make a big contribution to this project.

From a business perspective this seems like it has potential but I'm also fine if it doesn't go anywhere.
From a legal perspective I'm not too worried because that would come after this class.
