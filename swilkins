I'm interested in this project because I've been volunteering in elementary schools for years. I've helped with miscellaneous things, and it would have been nice to know the progress the child I was helping had made for most of those things.

As far as my contribution goes, I don't really care which part I help with. I haven't worked at all with React Native, but I do have experience with normal React, and I've programmed quite a bit for Android (using Java and XML). I have some experience with both kinds of databases as well.

Technical: I don't really have much to add here, it all sounds good.

Business: Same deal-- I'm totally fine with keeping it just to the free app. Probably all we'll have time for anyways.

Legal: I'm fine keeping it just to a school project.
