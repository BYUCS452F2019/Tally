Idea: Tally

I like this idea because it is a real pain, and in order to turn it into a business you could simply do business-to-business 
sales instead of marketing it to consumers. For example, if you get a contract to license your software to three school 
districts, you could charge them $5,000 dollars per school each year. This would help you to make over $100,000 a year. 
I also think that this project would be easy to scale. At first you could just keep the data and do simple analytics. After 
that you could use AI to recognize and read the actual worksheets and record them. As it grows, you could make a lot of money,
which is the real reason I like this idea. 

I am not an amazing programmer, but I could contribute some knowledge of front/back end. Mostly I am a hard worker so I would 
benefit this project. I can do any piece of the project you want. 

I already commented on the business aspects of this idea, but I want to re-iterate that I think it could be turned into a good 
business. When it comes to legality, we must be careful to obey laws such as Ferpa. This means that the data would need to be 
very secure. However, for the project itself, we don’t need to worry about legality. For the technical skills, I don’t know 
everything that is there, but I definitely can learn. I really want to learn AWS, so I would love to help on the back-end. I 
also don’t know React but am familiar with Vue and Angular. Overall, I think I can benefit this team.
