# Proposal to Join Tally

## Interest

I have a lot of respect for teachers who work hard to give children the best schooling they can in our current education system. Building an app to make it easier for them to teach children is a project I would really enjoy putting my time into.

## Qualifications

I've worked as a web programmer for two and a half years on campus. I'm very familiar with mySQL, and feel confident using it for this project. I also have experience designing a web page to be mobile-friendly, which will help while building the front end of this app.

## Comments

### Business

The MVP for this project sounds like a free app, but I agree it could scale easily into a paid version as we add more robust features to make it easier on the teachers.

### Legal

Legally, I can see privacy being our big issue during development, before we build in any security. I'd suggest doing a simple test data generator so we have enough data to manipulate; I know there's several open source data generators out there and we'd just have to choose one that works for us.

### Technical

I've used several different front-end frameworks, including React briefly, so I'm confident that whatever we decide to use, I'll be able to pick up on it quickly. The relational database I already know how to use, and I've encountered Google firebase before as well, though I didn't work on it for long.
